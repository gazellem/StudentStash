# StudentStash
### Actors
StudentStash is Bilkent University's social marketplace, designed to facilitate various transactions among Bilkent students and staff.
### Motivation
The motivation behind the creation of StudentStash at Bilkent University borns from the  absence of a unified and reliable social platform catering specifically to the needs of students and staff such as finding flatmates/roommates, borrowing or purchasing second-hand items.
### Goals
Currently available platforms do not adequately empower students to efficiently search for their needs or discover previous announcements that may align with their requirements. It also promotes user socialization by offering, chats, sections to find companions for certain activities, etc. StudentStash aims to address this issue by serving as a platform for Bilkenters to buy, sell, lend, donate items, search for lost belongings, or find housing/roommates.
The ultimate goal in developing this platform is to make campus life more convenient and sustainable for all Bilkenters.
